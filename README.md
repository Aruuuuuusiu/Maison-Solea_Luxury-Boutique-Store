## Project Overview

**Maison Solea** is a fully responsive, multi-page luxury footwear website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features an elegant, minimal aesthetic with glassmorphism elements, smooth animations, interactive carousels, and detailed product pages.

The project focuses on **modern front-end design**, **premium UI/UX patterns**, and **clean vanilla JavaScript interactivity**, making it a strong showcase of responsive layouts, DOM manipulation, and animation-heavy interfaces **without external frameworks**.
